### What I learned

This is my first frontendmentor challenge which i have used to implement fullstack app and i am really excitied about it.
I have learned how i can create a database tables in supabase and connect it to my react app and also i have learned how i can make crud operation on database using react query so it was too much fun to build it.

### Continued development

i will continue to build react apps by things which i have learned so far and i am at the end of the react course which i am following. i think i will do Guru challenge from frontenmentor. i might make it as a fullstack app using react query and supabase.
